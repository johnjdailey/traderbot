    #! Limit Order
    # A Limit order is an order to buy or sell at a specified price or better. The Limit order ensures that if the order fills, 
    # it will not fill at a price less favorable than your limit price, but it does not guarantee a fill.

    #? Will immediately try and buy/sell if the market hits that price,
    #? but will also execute even if it overshoots by a lot
    #? i.e. If the price suddenly falls by a lot past the price, it will execute the order at a very low price
    # A Stop order is an instruction to submit a buy or sell market order if and when the user-specified stop trigger price is attained or penetrated. 
    # A Stop order is not guaranteed a specific execution price and may execute significantly away from its stop price. 
    # A Sell Stop order is always placed below the current market price and is typically used to limit a loss or protect a profit on a long stock position. 
    # A Buy Stop order is always placed above the current market price. 
    # It is typically used to limit a loss or help protect a profit on a short sale.
